'''
Generates a json dictionary of package names with log levels.
The default level will be at key default_level.
Possible levels [ debug, info, warn, error, fatal ]
param: config_file_path The path to a log4j format .conf file.
       relevent log level lines should have the form log4j.logger.ros.<package_name>=<log_level>

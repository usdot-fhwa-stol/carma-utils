cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0.2)
project(bsm_helper)

## Compile as C++14, supported in ROS Noetic and newer
add_compile_options(-std=c++14)

## Find catkin macros and libraries
## if COMPONENTS list like find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS xyz)
## is used, also find other catkin packages
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
  
  roscpp
)
## System dependencies are found with CMake's conventions
find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)


###################################
## catkin specific configuration ##
###################################
## The catkin_package macro generates cmake config files for your package
## Declare things to be passed to dependent projects
## INCLUDE_DIRS: uncomment this if your package contains header files
## LIBRARIES: libraries you create in this project that dependent projects also need
## CATKIN_DEPENDS: catkin_packages dependent projects also need
## DEPENDS: system dependencies of this project that dependent projects also need
catkin_package(
INCLUDE_DIRS include
  LIBRARIES bsm_helper
  CATKIN_DEPENDS  roscpp
  DEPENDS EIGEN3 # Eigen is a special case where is needs to be in caps here but not in find_package
)

## Build ##

## Specify additional locations of header files
## Your package locations should be listed before other locations
include_directories(

## Declare a C++ library
add_library(bsm_helper

## Add cmake target dependencies of the library
## as an example, code may need to be generated before libraries
## either from message generation or dynamic reconfigure

## Specify libraries to link a library or executable target against
target_link_libraries(bsm_helper ${catkin_LIBRARIES})

# CARMAUtils
CARMAUtils contains packages relevent to or useful for developing components for usage with the CARMAPlatform

This package is required to build the CARMAPlatform repo and many of the device drivers

To add this repo to your CARMAPlatform project simply clone this repository into your Catkin workspace

# CARMAPlatform
The primary CARMAPlatform repository can be found [here](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/carma-platform) and is part of the [USDOT FHWA STOL](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/)
github organization. Documentation on how the CARMAPlatform functions, how it will evolve over time, and how you can contribute can be found at the above links as well

## Current Status of ROS 1 and ROS 2 Packages
The current CARMA Platform system operates as a hybrid of ROS 1 Noetic and ROS 2 Foxy components. While nearly all components have been upgraded to ROS 2 Foxy, a small amount of ROS 1 Noetic content still exists within the system, including some packages in this repository. For more information, please see the relevant documentation in the [carma-config](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/carma-config?tab=readme-ov-file#current-status-of-hybrid-ros-1ros-2-system) repository.

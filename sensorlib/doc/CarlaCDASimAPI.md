# Carla CDA Sim API

The Carla CDA Sim API provides programmatic access to the library functionality. The primary means of
accessing features is through a CarlaCDASimAPI object, which may be constructed from any piece of information sufficient to
establish a Carla connection.

First ensure the following environment variables are set which define the CARLA version being utilized:

| Environment Variable | Description                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LOAD_CARLA_EGG       | Set to True to load the CARLA Python API from an egg file. Leave blank to use a pip-managed CARLA client library. |
| CARLA_VERSION        | The CARLA version to load (ex: "0.0.14").                                                                         |
| CARLA_EGG_DIR        | (optional) Hint directory for searching for the CARLA egg file.                                                   |


Nex, build the API object.

```
api = CarlaCDASimAPI.build_from_host_spec(carla_host, carla_port)

# or...

api = CarlaCDASimAPI.build_from_client(carla_client)

# or...

api = CarlaCDASimAPI.build_from_world(carla_world)
```

The API object may then be used to indirectly build and manage sensors, and request output data. Sensors are located by
association with an infrastructure item, such as a traffic light post, and the sensor index within a co-located
collection of sensors. For example, a sensor with an infrastructure_id of 3 and sensor_id 0, is the 0th sensor
associated with infrastructure item 3.

The following sample loads configurations and constructs a sensor.

```
api = CarlaCDASimAPI.build_from_world(world)

infrastructure_id = 3
sensor_id = 7
detection_cycle_delay_seconds = 0.5
sensor_config  =  SimulatedSensorUtils.load_config_from_file(arg.sensor_config_filename)
simulated_sensor_config = sensor_config["simulated_sensor"]
carla_sensor_config = sensor_config["lidar_sensor"]
noise_model_config = SimulatedSensorUtils.load_config_from_file(arg.noise_model_config_filename)
user_offset = carla.Location(arg.x, arg.y, arg.z)
lidar_transform = carla.Transform(carla.Location(x=-0.5, z=1.8) + user_offset)

sensor = api.create_simulated_semantic_lidar_sensor(simulated_sensor_config, carla_sensor_config, noise_model_config,
                                                    detection_cycle_delay_seconds,
                                                    infrastructure_id, sensor_id,
                                                    lidar_transform.location, lidar_transform.rotation, vehicle.id)

```

Objects can be retrieved from the sensor directly:

```
detected_objects = sensor.get_detected_objects()
```

Objects can also be retrieved from another function context by using the API. (Note: Currently sensor access from the
API is only supported within the running Python context.)

```
detected_objects = api.get_detected_objects(3, 0)    # (infrastructure_id, sensor_id)
```

Previously-registered sensors can be obtained from the API.

```
sensor = api.get_simulated_sensor(3, 0)
detected_objects = sensor.get_detected_objects()
```

The CarlaCDASimAPI class provides the sensor registry and management interface, while the SimulatedLidarSensor contains the
direct sensor interface. Note that SimulatedLidarSensor is an extension of the SimulatedSensor base class, paving the
way for future sensors to be developed.

# SemanticLidarSensor Class

## Description

SemanticLidarSensor is a concrete sensor extending the SimulatedSensor interface.

A call to `compute_detected_objects()` forces computation of the processing pipeline, populating an internal cache of
DetectedObject's. These are immediately returned, and available subsequently through the `get_detected_objects()`
function.

Proper construction and thread initialization is handled by the CarlaCDASimAPI, which is the recommended sensor building
interface. If constructed directly, `compute_detected_objects()` must be configured to be called repeatedly at the
desired detection computation cadence. Note that this is a blocking function.

## Interface

    class SemanticLidarSensor(SimulatedSensor)
     |  SemanticLidarSensor(infrastructure_id, sensor_id, simulated_sensor_config, carla_sensor_config, carla_world, sensor, data_collector, noise_model)

     |  Wrapper for the CARLA Semantic Lidar Sensor, with additional post-processing logic to compute a list of
     |  detected objects in the scene.
     |  
     |  Data is reported as the carla.SemanticLidarMeasurement type through the callback registered to
     |  carla.Sensor.listen(self, callback):

     |      Constructor.
     |
